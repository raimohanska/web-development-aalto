Rich-client Web Development
---------------------------

See [Developing With Web Standards](http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/developing_with_web_standards/), especially chapters 4 and 6.

For jQuery, there are many tutorials, for instance, [this one](http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery).

RESTful Server Development
--------------------------

In the example, we used [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) programming language, the
[Scalatra](https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra) web framework and [SBT](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki) build tool
for building and running.

We also used [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for editing and compiling the code.
You need the IDEA Scala plugin for Scala projects. You can install this plugin using IDEA Settings. Instead of IDEA,
you can of course use any other editor or IDE, such as VIM or Eclipse (with Scala plugin).
